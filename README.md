# Calculator
Building a functional calculator


Update: 
-Completed the calculator project.
-Had to look up a tutorial. I feel more confident on arrays and objects. 
-Had to use ChatGPT to explain some codes.
-If asked to do this again from scratch, I think I can do it without a tutorial.
-But google is still needed.
